// Key- vaue pair rules

- key must be unique, if duplicate key is provided , it will update the existing key
- sequence of keys , the order of keys does not matter in objects

//characterstics of objects

- inefficient for looping compared to arrays (higher Time Complexity)
- comma separation: Just like arrays objects key value pair are separated by comma (,)
- key behaviour : keys are assumed to e string , Java Script converts nonstring keys into string automatically
