{
    const name = "Rohit";
    // const name = "Jadhav"; "not valid",because of redeclaration of name
    // const a; error , const must be initialized during declaration -> const a = 6 or something
    console.log(a);
    console.log(name);
}
// console.log(name);//this gives error , becuase const is block variable  like let
